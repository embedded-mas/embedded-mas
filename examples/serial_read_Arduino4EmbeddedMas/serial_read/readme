*** Example under development ***

This example illustrates the reading of a serial port following a given protocol.
Each message comming from the serial has the following format: <preamble><message length><start message symbol><message><end message symbol


To run it:
  (i) upload the Embedded_Protocol.ino in the arduino folder to an arduino device
  (ii) assign permissions to read/write in the serial folder. In Unix systems, use sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0 (replacing "ttyUSB0" by the proper usb port)
  (iii) set the proper usb port in SerialRead.java
  (iv) in a terminal, type ./gradlew run <ENTER>

# Example of ROS-Based agent

## Scenario

This example illustrates an agent whose (i) beliefs include values read from ROS topics and (ii) whose actions include writing in ROS Topics.

The scenario includes the topics ```value1``` and ```value2```, which store integer values. When `value1` changes, the agent increments its value and writes it in `value2`. When `value2` changes, the agent increments its value and writes it in `value1`. This process runs in a loop.

The scenario also includes a topic `current_time`, which stores a string describing the current time. The agent perceives this information and updates the topic.

## Requirements
1. ROS (recommended [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic))
2. [Rosbridge](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge_suite/Tutorials/RunningRosbridge)


## Running the example

1. Start the roscore:
```
roscore
```

2. Launch the bridge between ROS and Java
```
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```

3. Write some initial values in ROS topics
```
rostopic pub /value1 std_msgs/Int32 0
rostopic pub /current_time std_msgs/String "unknown"
```

4. Launch the JaCaMo application:

Linux:
```
./gradlew run
```
Windows:
```
gradlew run 
```

## Some notes on the ROS-Jason integration
This integration is part of a broader integration framework available [here](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas)

Agents are configured in the jcm file (in this example, [perception_action.jcm](perception_action.jcm)). This example has what we call a <em>cyber-physical agent</em>, which is a software agent that includes physical elements. It may get perceptions from sensors while its actions' repertory may include those enabled by physical actuators. Cyber-physical agents are implemented by the class [`CyberPhysicalAgent`](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas/blob/master/src/main/java/embedded/mas/bridges/jacamo/CyberPhysicalAgent.java), that extends [Jason Agents](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason/blob/master/src/main/java/jason/asSemantics/Agent.java). The physical portion of cyber-physical agents is set up in a yaml file with the same name and placed in the same folder as the asl file where the agent is specified. In this example, this file is placed [here](src/agt/sample_agent.yaml).


A cyber-physical agent can be composed of one to many <em>devices</em>, which are defined in the yaml configuration file. A <em>device</em> is any external element which sensors and actuators are connected to. A device may be either physical (e.g. an Arduino board), or virtual (e.g. a ROS core). Each device has a unique identifier, which is set in the ```device_id``` key of the yaml file. In this example, the agent is composed of a single device, that is a ROS core identified as <em>sample_roscore</em>. An agent can connect with multiple ROS core, if necessary (it is not the case in this example). Besides, an agent can connect with non-ros devices (not shown in this example). Any device is implemented by a Java class that provides interfaces between the parception/action systems of the agent and the real device, according to the [IDevice interface](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas/blob/master/src/main/java/embedded/mas/bridges/jacamo/IDevice.java). In this example, it is implemented by the class [RosMaster](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas/blob/master/src/main/java/embedded/mas/bridges/ros/RosMaster.java). The device implementing class is defined in the ```className``` key of the configuration file. In addition, a <em>device</em> has three essential configuration items: <em>microcontrollers</em>, <em>perception sources</em>, and <em>enabled actions</em>. These items are explained below.

### Microcontrolers configuration
A device has a <em>microcontroller</em>, which is a Java interface that enables reading from and writing in the physical/virtual device. This interface is set up under the ```microcontroller``` key in the yaml file. Any microcontroller has an identifier, defined in the key ```id```. Any microcontroller implementation must implement the [IExternalInterface](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas/blob/master/src/main/java/embedded/mas/bridges/jacamo/IExternalInterface.java). In this example, it is implemented by the class [DefaultRos4EmbeddedMas](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas/blob/master/src/main/java/embedded/mas/bridges/ros/DefaultRos4EmbeddedMas.java). The device implementing class is defined in the ```microcontroller/className``` key of the configuration file. In addition, different microcontrollers may have some parameters that are depending on their nature. For example, serial devices like Arduino require configuring serial ports and baud rates. In this example, the microcontroller is a ROS-Java interface. It has a ROS specific parameter, whose key is ```connectionString```. It sets the connection string to the ROS core (e.g. ws://localhost:9090).

### Perception configuration
The sensors connected to a <em>device</em> may be source of perceptions of the agent. If the device is a ROS core, then these sensors are abstracted through topics. The list of topics that produce perceptions is configured in the ```perceptionTopics``` item in the yaml file. Each topic requires to define its name and its type, through the keys ```topicName``` and ```topicType```, respectively. These perceptions produce beliefs in the agent's mind. By default, the belief name has the same identifier (or <em>functor</em>) as the topic identifier. For instance, in this example, the topic ```value1``` produces the belief ```value1(I)```, where ```I``` is an integer number. It is also possible to customize the belief using the optional key ```beliefName```, whose value is the intended belief name. For instance, in this example, the topic ```current_time``` produces the belief ```current_hour(S)```, where ```S``` is a string.

   
### Action configuration   
The actions enabled by the actuators connected to a <em>device</em> may be included in the agent's action repertory. If the device is a ROS core, then these actions may be realized both through topic writings and service requests, configured in the keys ```topicWritingActions``` and ```serviceRequestActions``` of the yaml file, respectively. In this example, the agent performs only topic writing actions, that require the following configurations:

   - ```actionName```: the name of the action performed by the agent;

   - ```topicName```: the name of the topic affected by the action;

   - ```topicType```: the type of the topic.

Notice that the action and topic names may differ. For instance, in this example, the action <em>update_value1</em> is realized through a writing in the topic <em>/value1</em>. The agent action and the physical/virtual actuation are thus decoupled.

# The root item of the EmbeddedAgent configuration is the Device.
# An embedded agent can be composed of one to many devices. A device is any external element (physical or virtual) which sensors and actuators are connected to.
# In this example, the agent is composed of a single device, that is a ROS core identified as "sample_roscore".
- device_id: sample_roscore #device identifier. It is up to the designer to choose this name.
  #className: the class that implements the interface between the parception/action systems and the device.
  #           This class provides means to convert (i) sensor values in perceptions and (ii) action of the agents and actuations performed by the physical actuators.
  #           Different interfaces can be implemented for different types of devices.
  className:  embedded.mas.bridges.ros.RosMaster
  # A device contains a microcontroller, that is an interface that provides access to external devices to get percepts and perform actuations
  # Different microcontrollers have different parameters depending on their nature. For example, serial devices like Arduino require to configure serial ports and baudrates.
  # In this example, the microcontroller is a Java-ROS interface with parameters related to topics and services.

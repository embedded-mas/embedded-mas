### Examples of JaCaMo-ROS integration

This folder includes examples of Jason agents, that are part of the JaCaMo framework, with ROS. All the examples illustrate perceptions/beliefs acquired from reading of ROS topics. Besides, different examples illustrate different possible actions of Jason-ROS integrated agents:

1. [perception_action_topicWritingAction](perception_action_topicWritingAction): example where actons of the agents are based on writing in ROS topics.
1. [perception_action_serviceAction](perception_action_serviceAction): example where actons of the agents are based on requesting ROS services.
